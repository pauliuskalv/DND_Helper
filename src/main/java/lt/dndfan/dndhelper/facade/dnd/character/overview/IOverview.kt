/**
 * I think this is not needed at all, since there is no need to incorporate several facades into one, should probably delete this
 * ----------------------------------
 * Not sure if character overview package interfaces should be separated as classes and a single interface, because the interfaces seem quite different
 * This should be responsible for standard character 'dashboard'
 * Should incorporate facades of spells, inventory, stats, traits/feats, and character personality?
